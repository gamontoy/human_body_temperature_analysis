## What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
### Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 98.6 degrees for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

With the use of inference analysis for hypothesis testing (e.g. bootstrap methods), a conclusion is reached. 

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the sample size was large enough to use the CLT and assume a normal distribution of the temperature. The analysis proved that the average body temperature may not be 98.6 degrees as the one-sample test gave a small enough p-value.In addition, the small p-value given by the two-sample test proves that it is not likely that females and males share the same mean temperature.
